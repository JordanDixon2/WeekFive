- Downloaded Inkscape
- Saved pdf of graph, and imported it into inkscape using default settings.
- Selected object -> ungroup, seems like it understood that it was looking at a bar graph and separated every component?
- I was not able to follow the exact steps to rotate the number on the Y-axis. But I managed to do it by selecting 'edit paths by nodes', selecting the number, then reselecting 'select and transform objects' then rotating it with the arrows at the top left.
- I realized what I did wrong in the last step, was that you have to really give it a good bunch of clicks until it selects the specific piece you are looking for. I never concidered quintuple-clicking.
- Now that I knew that, selecting a specific bar from the graph and changing its color was very simple.
- Saved it, selected all in all layers, and I could not find the option of export bitmap, but I was able to find the option export png image, which is the same thing, and it saved a png image of my creation to my folder.
- Downloaded the default poster from the github.
- I had a good bit of fun playing around in inkscape turning my favorite essay into a poster, so I forgot to take notes of the changes I made while doing it.
- I was mostly playing around will of the things I could do, but the idea of my presentation is sound. What works well in my opinion, is that I layed it out to start in the middle, and circle outwards more and more.
- The title is smack in the middle of the poster, then in the outside spaces, I put the relevant information I want you to know before going further into it, and then elaborated on my two main points on the outer corners.
- What didn't work well is how I actually did it, I honestly did not want to waste too much time doing this, so some of the text and image wrapping looks messy. I think this would have looked good if I spent a lot more time on it.
- Audacity is incapable of detecting my microphone, no matter where I plug it in or what settings I use, so I spoke with Dr. Graham and I was given the OK to use anchor.
- It detected my microphone immediately, and I got to recording. The podcast ran a bit long, but I still added in an intro and outro theme just for fun, to play around with the website's capabilities.

- The quick static site exercise was great because I learned a lot very quickly.
- I made the files, chose a theme, and then I just messed around changing some text and then adding my own gif for fun.
